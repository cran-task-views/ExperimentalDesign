  <p>This task view collects information on R packages for experimental design
  and analysis of data from experiments. Please feel free to
  suggest enhancements, and please send information on new packages or major 
  package updates if you think they belong here. Contact details are given on my
  <a href="http://prof.beuth-hochschule.de/groemping/DoE">Web page</a>.</p>
  
  <p>Experimental design is applied in many areas, and methods have been tailored 
  to the needs of various fields. This task view starts out with a section on 
  the most general packages, continues with specific sections on agricultural and 
  industrial experimentation, computer experiments, and experimentation in the
  clinical trials contexts, and closes with a section on various special 
  experimental design packages that have been developed for other specific purposes.
  Of course, the division into fields is not always clear-cut, and some packages from 
  the more specialized sections can also be applied in general contexts. <br/>
  You may also notice that my own experience is mainly from industrial experimentation 
  (in a broad sense), which may explain a somewhat biased view on things.</p>

  <h3>Experimental designs for general purposes</h3>
  <p>There are a few packages for creating and analyzing experimental designs
  for general purposes: First of all, the standard (generalized) linear model
  functions in the base package stats are of course very important for analyzing
  data from designed experiments (especially functions <code>lm()</code>, <code>aov()</code>
  and the methods and functions for the resulting linear model objects). These are
  concisely explained in Kuhnert and Venables (2005, p. 109 ff.); Vikneswaran (2005)
  points out specific usages for experimental design (using function <code>contrasts()</code>,
  multiple comparison functions and some convenience functions like <code>model.tables()</code>,
  <code>replications()</code> and <code>plot.design()</code>). Lalanne (2009) 
  provides an R companion to the well-known book by Montgomery (2005); he so far covers the first 
  few chapters only and (understandably!) does not keep pace with the fast development 
  of R regarding experimental design facilities. 
  <pkg>GAD</pkg> handles 
  general balanced analysis of variance models with fixed and/or random effects 
  and also nested effects (the latter can only be random); they quote Underwood 1997 for this work.
  The package is quite valuable, as many 
  users have difficulties with using the R packages for handling random or mixed effects. 
  <pkg>granova</pkg> 
  offers some interesting non-standard graphical representations for results of simply-structured 
  experiments (one-way and two-way layouts, paired data).</p> 

  <ul>
  <li>Package <pkg>AlgDesign</pkg> creates full
  factorial designs with or without additional quantitative variables, creates mixture
  designs (i.e., designs where the levels of factors sum to 1=100%; lattice designs are created only) and creates
  D-, A-, or I-optimal designs exactly or approximately. <b>NOTE: Bob Wheeler, the author 
  and maintainer of <pkg>AlgDesign</pkg>, would like to retire from this job and is looking 
  for an "heir" whom he can entrust with continuing the package. Please contact Bob, if you 
  are interested.</b></li> 
  <li>Package <pkg>conf.design</pkg> allows 
  to create a design with certain interaction effects confounded with blocks (function
  <code>conf.design()</code>) and allows to combine existing designs in several ways
  (e.g., useful for Taguchi's inner and outer array designs in industrial experimentation). </li>
  <li>Package <pkg>planor</pkg> allows 
  to generate regular fractional factorial designs with fixed and mixed levels 
  and quite flexible randomization structures. The packages flexibility 
  comes at the price of a certain complexity and - for larger designs - high computing time.</li>
  <li>Package <pkg>crossdes</pkg> creates and analyses cross-over designs of various types (including
  latin squares, mutually orthogonal latin squares and Youden squares) that can for example
  be used in sensometrics. </li>
  <li>Package <pkg>DoE.base</pkg> provides full factorial designs with or without blocking 
  (function <code>fac.design</code>) and orthogonal arrays (function <code>oa.design</code>) 
  for main effects experiments 
  (those listed by Kuhfeld 2009 up to 144 runs, plus a few additional ones). 
  There is also some experimental functionality 
  for assessing the quality of orthogonal arrays.<br/>
  Package <pkg>DoE.base</pkg> also forms the basis of a suite of related packages (cf. Groemping 2009). 
  Together with <pkg>FrF2</pkg> (cf. above) and <pkg>DoE.wrapper</pkg>, it provides the work horse 
  of the GUI package <pkg>RcmdrPlugin.DoE</pkg> (beta version; tutorial available in Groemping 2011), which integrates 
  design of experiments functionality into the R-Commander (package "Rcmdr", Fox 2005) 
  for the benefit of those R users who cannot or do not want to do command line programming. 
  The role of package <pkg>DoE.wrapper</pkg> in that suite is to wrap 
  functionality from other packages into the input and output structure of the package suite 
  (so far for response surface designs with package <pkg>rsm</pkg> (cf. also below), 
  design of computer experiments with packages <pkg>lhs</pkg> and <pkg>DiceDesign</pkg> (cf. also below), 
  and , and D-optimal designs with package <pkg>AlgDesign</pkg> (cf. also above). 
  </li>
  
  <li>Package <pkg>dae</pkg> provides various utility functions around experimental design 
  and R factors, e.g. a randomization routine that can handle various nested structures 
  (according to Bailey 1981) and functions for combining several factors into one 
  or dividing one factor into several factors. 
  Furthermore, the package provides features for post-processing 
  objects returned by the <code>aov()</code> function, e.g. extraction of Yates effects 
  for 2-level experiments.</li>
  <li><pkg>blockTools</pkg> assigns units to blocks in order to end up with homogeneous sets
  of blocks in case of too small block sizes.</li> 
</ul>

  <h3>Experimental designs for agricultural and plant breeding experiments</h3>
  <p><pkg>agricolae</pkg> offers extensive functionality on experimental design 
  especially for agricultural and plant breeding experiments, which can also be useful 
  for other purposes. It supports <i>planning</i> of lattice designs, factorial designs, 
  randomized complete block designs, completely randomized designs, 
  (Graeco-)Latin square designs, balanced incomplete block designs and alpha designs. 
  There are also various <i>analysis</i> facilities for experimental data, e.g. treatment 
  comparison procedures and several non-parametric tests, but also some quite specialized 
  possibilities for specific types of experiments.</p>

  <h3>Experimental designs for industrial experiments</h3>
  <p>Some further packages especially handle designs for industrial experiments
  that are often highly fractionated, intentionally confounded and have few extra degrees
  of freedom for error.</p> 
  
  <p>Fractional factorial 2-level designs are particularly important in industrial 
  experimentation. 
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>Package <pkg>FrF2</pkg> is the most comprehensive R package for 
  their creation. It generates regular Fractional Factorial 
  designs for factors with 2 levels as well as Plackett-Burman type screening designs. 
  Regular fractional factorials default to maximum resolution minimum aberration designs 
  and can be customized in various ways, supported by an 
  incorporated catalogue of designs (including the designs catalogued by Chen, Sun and Wu 1993, 
  and further larger designs catalogued in Block and Mee 2005 and Xu 2009; 
  the additional package <pkg>FrF2.catlg128</pkg> provides a very large complete catalogue 
  for resolution IV 128 run designs with up to 23 factors for special purposes). 
  Analysis-wise, <pkg>FrF2</pkg> provides simple graphical analysis tools (normal and half-normal effects plots 
  (modified from <pkg>BsMD</pkg>, cf. below), main effects 
  plots and interaction plot matrices similar to those in Minitab software, and a cube 
  plot for the combinations of three factors). It can also show the alias structure 
  for regular fractional factorials of 2-level factors, regardless whether they have been 
  created with the package or not.<br/> 
  Fractional factorial 2-level plans can also be created by other R packages, 
  namely <pkg>BHH2</pkg> and <pkg>qualityTools</pkg> (but do not use function pbDesign from 
  version 1.54 of that package!), or with a little bit more complication 
  by packages <pkg>conf.design</pkg>, <pkg>planor</pkg> or <pkg>AlgDesign</pkg>.</li>
  
  <li>Package <pkg>BHH2</pkg> accompanies the 2nd edition of the book by Box, Hunter and Hunter 
  and provides various of its data sets. It can generate full and fractional factorial 
  two-level-designs from a number of factors and a list of defining relations 
  (function <code>ffDesMatrix()</code>, less comfortable than package FrF2). 
  It also provides several functions for analyzing data from 2-level factorial 
  experiments: The function anovaPlot assesses effect sizes relative to residuals, and
  the function <code>lambdaPlot()</code> assesses the effect of Box-Cox transformations on
  statistical significance of effects. </li>
  <li><pkg>BsMD</pkg> provides Bayesian charts as
  proposed by Box and Meyer (1986) as well as effects plots (normal, half-normal and
  Lenth) for assessing which effects are active in a fractional factorial experiment
  with 2-level factors. </li>
  </ul>
   
  <p>
  Apart from tools for planning and analysing factorial designs, R also offers support for 
  response surface optimization for quantitative factors (cf. e.g. Myers and Montgomery 1995): 
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>Package <pkg>rsm</pkg> supports sequential 
  optimization with first order and second order response surface models (central composite 
  or Box-Behnken designs), offering 
  optimization approaches like steepest ascent and visualization of the response 
  function for linear model objects. Also, coding for response surface investigations is 
  facilitated. </li>
  <li>Package <pkg>DoE.wrapper</pkg> enhances design creation from package <pkg>rsm</pkg> 
  with the possibilities of automatically choosing the cube portion of central 
  composite designs and of augmenting 
  an existing (fractional) factorial 2-level design with a star portion. </li>
  <li>Package <pkg>Vdgraph</pkg> implements a variance dispersion graph (Vining 1993) for response 
  surface designs created by package <pkg>rsm</pkg>. </li>
  <li>Package <pkg>qualityTools</pkg> can also create central composite designs 
  and can visualize response surfaces.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>In some industries, mixtures of ingredients are important; these require special designs, 
  because the quantitative factors have a fixed total. 
  Mixture designs are handled by packages <pkg>AlgDesign</pkg> (function <code>gen.mixture</code>, 
  lattice designs), <pkg>qualityTools</pkg> (function <code>mixDesign</code>, 
  lattice designs and simplex centroid designs), and <pkg>mixexp</pkg> (several small functions for simplex centroid, 
  simplex lattice and extreme vertices designs as well as for plotting). </p>

  <p>Occasionally, supersaturated designs can be useful. 
  The two small packages <pkg>mkssd</pkg> and <pkg>mxkssd</pkg> provide fixed level and mixed level 
  k-circulant supersaturated designs.</p>

  <h3>Experimental designs for computer experiments</h3>
  <p>Computer experiments with quantitative factors require special types of 
  experimental designs: it is often possible to include many different 
  levels of the factors, and replication will usually not be beneficial. Also, the 
  experimental region is often too large to assume that a linear or quadratic model adequately 
  represents the phenomenon under investigation. Consequently, it is desirable to fill 
  the experimental space with points as well as possible (space-filling designs) in such 
  a way that each run provides additional information even if some factors turn out to be 
  irrelevant.
  The <pkg>lhs</pkg> package provides latin hypercube designs for this purpose. 
  Furthermore, the package provides ways to analyse such computer experiments with
  emphasis on what follow-up experiments to conduct. Another package with similar orientation 
  is the <pkg>DiceDesign</pkg> package, which adds further ways to construct space-filling 
  designs and some measures to assess the quality of designs for computer experiments. The 
  package <pkg>DiceKriging</pkg> provides the kriging methodology which is often used for 
  creating meta models from computer experiments, the package <pkg>DiceEval</pkg> creates 
  and evaluates meta models (among others Kriging ones), and the package <pkg>DiceView</pkg> 
  provides facilities for viewing sections of multidimensional meta models.</p>
  
  <p>Package <pkg>tgp</pkg> is another package dedicated to planning and analysing 
  computer experiments. Here, emphasis is on Bayesian methods. 
  The package can for example be used with various kinds of (surrogate) models for 
  sequential optimization, e.g. with an expected improvement criterion for optimizing a noisy 
  blackbox target function. Packages <pkg>plgp</pkg> and <pkg>dynaTree</pkg> enhance the 
  functionality offered by <pkg>tgp</pkg> with particle learning facilities and learning for 
  dynamic regression trees.</p>
  
  <p>Package <pkg>BatchExperiments</pkg> is also designed for computer 
  experiments, in this case specifically for experiments with algorithms to be run 
  under different scenarios. The package is described in a technical report by 
  Bischl et al. (2012).</p>

  <h3>Experimental designs for clinical trials</h3>
  <p>This task view only covers specific design of experiments packages; there may be some 
  grey areas. Please, also consult the <a href="ClinicalTrials.html">ClinicalTrials</a> task view. 
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li><pkg>experiment</pkg> contains tools for clinical experiments,
  e.g., a randomization tool, and it provides a few special analysis options for clinical
  trials.</li> 
  <li>Package <pkg>gsDesign</pkg> implements group sequential designs,</li> 
  <li>Package <pkg>gsbDesign</pkg> evaluates operating characteristics for group sequential Bayesian designs,</li> 
  <li>package <pkg>asd</pkg> implements adaptive sequential designs.</li> 
  <li>Package <pkg>TEQR</pkg> 
  provides toxicity equivalence range designs (Blanchard and Longmate 2010) for phase I clinical trials.</li> 
  <li>The <pkg>DoseFinding</pkg> package provides functions for the design and analysis 
  of dose-finding experiments (for example pharmaceutical Phase II clinical trials); 
  it combines the facilities of the "MCPMod" package (maintenance discontinued; 
  described in Bornkamp, Pinheiro and Bretz 2009) with a special type of optimal designs for 
  dose finding situations (MED-optimal designs, or D-optimal designs, or a mixture of both; 
  cf., Dette et al. 2008).</li> 
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Experimental designs for special purposes</h3>
  <p>Various further packages handle special situations in experimental design:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Package <pkg>desirability</pkg> provides ways to combine several target criteria into a desirability function in order to simplify
  multi-criteria analysis; desirabilities are also offered as part of package <pkg>qualityTools</pkg>.</li> 
  <li><pkg>osDesign</pkg> designs studies nested in observational studies,</li>
  <li><pkg>qtlDesign</pkg> is for quantitative trait locus designs,</li>
  <li>package <pkg>SensoMineR</pkg> contains special designs for
  sensometric studies, e.g., for the triangle test.</li>
  <li>Package <pkg>support.CEs</pkg> provides tools for creating stated choice designs 
  for market research investigations.</li>
  </ul>
