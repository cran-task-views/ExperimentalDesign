  <p>This task view collects information on R packages for experimental design
  and analysis of data from experiments. With a strong increase in the number of 
  relevant packages, packages that focus on analysis only and do not make relevant 
  contributions for design creation are no longer added to this task view. 
   Please feel free to
  suggest enhancements, and please send information on new packages or major 
  package updates if you think they belong here. Contact details are given on my
  <a href="http://prof.beuth-hochschule.de/groemping/DoE">Web page</a>.</p>
  
  <p>Experimental design is applied in many areas, and methods have been tailored 
  to the needs of various fields. This task view starts out with a section on 
  the historically earliest application area, agricultural experimentation. 
  Subsequently, it covers the most general packages, continues with 
  specific sections on industrial experimentation, computer experiments, and 
  experimentation in the clinical trials contexts 
  (this section is going to be removed eventually; experimental design packages for 
  clinical trials will be integrated into the clinical trials task view),
  and closes with a section on various special 
  experimental design packages that have been developed for other specific purposes.
  Of course, the division into fields is not always clear-cut, and some packages from 
  the more specialized sections can also be applied in general contexts. <br/>
  You may also notice that my own experience is mainly from industrial experimentation 
  (in a broad sense), which may explain a somewhat biased view on things.</p>

  <h3>Experimental designs for agricultural and plant breeding experiments</h3>
  <p>Package <pkg>agricolae</pkg> is by far the most-used package from this task view (status: October 2017). 
  It offers extensive functionality on experimental design 
  especially for agricultural and plant breeding experiments, which can also be useful 
  for other purposes. It supports <i>planning</i> of lattice designs, factorial designs, 
  randomized complete block designs, completely randomized designs, 
  (Graeco-)Latin square designs, balanced incomplete block designs and alpha designs. 
  There are also various <i>analysis</i> facilities for experimental data, e.g. treatment 
  comparison procedures and several non-parametric tests, but also some quite specialized 
  possibilities for specific types of experiments. Package <pkg>desplot</pkg> is made 
  for plotting the layout of agricultural experiments. Package <pkg>agridat</pkg> 
  offers a large repository of useful agricultural data sets.</p>

    <h3>Experimental designs for general purposes</h3>
  <p>There are a few packages for creating and analyzing experimental designs
  for general purposes: First of all, the standard (generalized) linear model
  functions in the base package stats are of course very important for analyzing
  data from designed experiments (especially functions <code>lm()</code>, <code>aov()</code>
  and the methods and functions for the resulting linear model objects). These are
  concisely explained in Kuhnert and Venables (2005, p. 109 ff.); Vikneswaran (2005)
  points out specific usages for experimental design (using function <code>contrasts()</code>,
  multiple comparison functions and some convenience functions like <code>model.tables()</code>,
  <code>replications()</code> and <code>plot.design()</code>). 
  Lawson (2014) is a good introductory textbook on experimental design in R, which 
  gives many example applications. 
  Lalanne (2012)   provides an R companion to the well-known book by Montgomery (2005); 
  he so far covers approximately the first 
  ten chapters; he does not include R's design generation facilities, but mainly 
  discusses the analysis of existing designs. 
  Package <pkg>GAD</pkg> handles 
  general balanced analysis of variance models with fixed and/or random effects 
  and also nested effects (the latter can only be random); they quote Underwood (1997) for this work.
  The package is quite valuable, as many 
  users have difficulties with using the R packages for handling random or mixed effects. 
  Package <pkg>granova</pkg> 
  offers some interesting non-standard graphical representations for results of simply-structured 
  experiments (one-way and two-way layouts, paired data), package <pkg>ez</pkg> aims at supporting 
  intuitive analysis and visualization of factorial experiments based on package "ggplot2".
  </p> 

  <ul>
  <li>Package <pkg>AlgDesign</pkg> creates full
  factorial designs with or without additional quantitative variables, creates mixture
  designs (i.e., designs where the levels of factors sum to 1=100%; lattice designs are created only) and creates
  D-, A-, or I-optimal designs exactly or approximately, possibly with blocking, using the Federov (1972) algorithm.</li>
  <li>Package <pkg>skpr</pkg> also provides optimal designs (D, I, A, Alias, G, T, or E optimal); a 
  selection of the optimality criteria can also be used for the stepwise creation of split-plot designs. The package 
  can also assess the power of designs and display diagnostic plots. At the moment (October 2017), the 
  algorithms used are not yet documented.</li> 
  <li>Package <pkg>OptimalDesign</pkg> likewise calculates unblocked D-, A-, or I-optimal designs 
  (they use "IV-optimal" instead of "I-optimal") exactly or approximately, 
  treating quantitative variables only, including mixture designs; 
  this package uses different algorithms (e.g. Atkinson, Donev and Tobias 2007, Harman and Filova 2014), 
  some of which rely on the availability of the gurobi software 
  (<a href="http://www.gurobi.com/">http://www.gurobi.com/</a>, free for academics and academic institutions) 
  and its accompanying R package "gurobi" (not on CRAN).</li>
   <li>Package <pkg>ICAOD</pkg> implements the 
  "Imperialist Competitive Algorithm for Optimal Designs" for nonlinear models 
  according to Masoudi, Holling and Wong (2016). 
  Package <pkg>LDOD</pkg> implements locally D-optimal designs 
  for some nonlinear and generalized linear models, package <pkg>designGLMM</pkg> locally 
  optimal designs for completely randomized or blocked Poisson models and 
  package <pkg>PopED</pkg> provides optimal designs for nonlinear mixed effect models.</li> 
  <li>There are various further packages that deal with optimal designs of different types: 
  package <pkg>oapackage</pkg> 
  allows to generate (not necessarily orthogonal) 
  optimal fractional factorial 2-level designs with the possibility to prioritize 
  main effects higher than interactions. Package <pkg>rodd</pkg> provides T-optimal designs, 
  also called optimal discriminating designs (Dette, Melas and Shpilev 2013,
  Dette, Melas  and Guchenko 2014), Package <pkg>acebayes</pkg>
  calculates optimal Bayesian designs using an approximate coordinate exchange algorithm, 
  package <pkg>OBsMD</pkg> provides "Objective Bayesian Model Discrimination in Follow-Up Designs" 
  according to Consonni and Deldossi (2015). Further optimal design packages for 
  very specific purposes are listed at the end of this view.
  </li> 
  <li>Package <pkg>conf.design</pkg> allows 
  to create a design with certain interaction effects confounded with blocks (function
  <code>conf.design()</code>) and allows to combine existing designs in several ways
  (e.g., useful for Taguchi's inner and outer array designs in industrial experimentation). </li>
  <li>Package <pkg>planor</pkg> allows 
  to generate regular fractional factorial designs with fixed and mixed levels 
  and quite flexible randomization structures. The packages flexibility 
  comes at the price of a certain complexity and - for larger designs - high computing time.</li>
  <li>Package <pkg>ibd</pkg> creates and analyses incomplete block designs. Packages 
  <pkg>PGM2</pkg>, <pkg>RPPairwiseDesign</pkg> and <pkg>CombinS</pkg> all produce designs 
  related to (resolvable) (partially) balanced incomplete block designs. Package <pkg>PBIBD</pkg> 
  also provides experts with some series of partially balanced incomplete block designs.</li>
  <li>Package <pkg>crossdes</pkg> creates and analyses cross-over designs of various types (including
  latin squares, mutually orthogonal latin squares and Youden squares) that can for example
  be used in sensometrics. Package <pkg>Crossover</pkg> also provides crossover designs; 
  it offers designs from the literature and algorithmic designs, makes use of the 
  functionality in <pkg>crossdes</pkg> and in addition provides a GUI.</li>
  <li>Package <pkg>DoE.base</pkg> provides full factorial designs with or without blocking 
  (function <code>fac.design</code>) and orthogonal arrays (function <code>oa.design</code>) 
  for main effects experiments 
  (those listed by Kuhfeld 2009 up to 144 runs, plus a few additional ones). 
  There is also some functionality for assessing the quality of orthogonal arrays, 
  related to Groemping and Xu (2014) and Groemping (2017), 
  and some analysis functionality with half-normal effects plots in 
  quite general form (Groemping 2015).<br/>
  Package <pkg>DoE.base</pkg> also forms the basis of a suite of related packages: 
  together with <pkg>FrF2</pkg> (cf. below) and <pkg>DoE.wrapper</pkg>, it provides the work horse 
  of the GUI package <pkg>RcmdrPlugin.DoE</pkg> (beta version; tutorial available in Groemping 2011), 
  which integrates 
  design of experiments functionality into the R-Commander (package "Rcmdr", Fox 2005) 
  for the benefit of those R users who cannot or do not want to do command line programming. 
  The role of package <pkg>DoE.wrapper</pkg> in that suite is to wrap 
  functionality from other packages into the input and output structure of the package suite 
  (so far for response surface designs with package <pkg>rsm</pkg> (cf. also below), 
  design of computer experiments with packages <pkg>lhs</pkg> and <pkg>DiceDesign</pkg> (cf. also below), 
  and , and D-optimal designs with package <pkg>AlgDesign</pkg> (cf. also above). 
  </li>
  <li>Package <pkg>DoE.MIParray</pkg> creates optimized orthogonal arrays (or even supersaturated arrays)
  for factorial experiments. Arrays created with this package can be used as input 
  to function oa.design of package <pkg>DoE.base</pkg>. 
  Note, however, that the package is only useful in combination with at least one of the commercial 
  optimizers <a href="http://www.gurobi.com/products/modeling-languages/r">Gurobi</a> 
  (R-package gurobi delivered with the software) or <a href="https://www.mosek.com/documentation/">Mosek</a>
  (R-package Rmosek downloadable from the vendor (an outdated version is on CRAN)).
  </li>
  <li>Package <pkg>dae</pkg> provides various utility functions around experimental design 
  and R factors, e.g. a randomization routine that can handle various nested structures 
  (according to Bailey 1981) and functions for combining several factors into one 
  or dividing one factor into several factors. 
  Furthermore, the package provides features for post-processing 
  objects returned by the <code>aov()</code> function, e.g. extraction of Yates effects 
  for 2-level experiments.</li>
  <li>Package <pkg>daewr</pkg> accompanies the book <i>Design and Analysis of Experiments with R</i> 
  by Lawson (2014) and does not only provide data sets from the book but also some standalone functionality 
  that is not available elsewhere in R, e.g. definitive screening designs.</li>
  <li>Package <pkg>OPDOE</pkg> accompanies the book <i>Optimal Experimental Design with
   R</i> by Rasch et al. (2011). It has some interesting sample size estimation functionality, 
   but is almost unusable without the book (the first edition of which I would not recommend buying).</li> 
  <li>Package <pkg>blockTools</pkg> assigns units to blocks in order to end up with homogeneous sets
  of blocks in case of too small block sizes; package <pkg>blocksdesign</pkg> permits 
  the creation of nested block structures.</li>
  <li>There are several packages for determining sample sizes in experimental contexts, 
  some of them quite general, others very specialized. All of these are mentioned here: 
  packages <pkg>powerAnalysis</pkg>, <pkg>powerbydesign</pkg> and <pkg>easypower</pkg> deal with estimating 
  the power, sample size and/or effect size for factorial experiments. Package <pkg>JMdesign</pkg> 
  deals with the power for the special situation of jointly modeling longitudinal and survival data,
  package <pkg>PwrGSD</pkg> with the power for group sequential designs, 
  package <pkg>powerGWASinteraction</pkg> with the power for interactions in genome wide association studies, 
  package <pkg>ssizeRNA</pkg> with sample size for RNA sequencing experiments, and package <pkg>ssize.fdr</pkg> 
  for sample sizes in microarray experiments (requesting a certain power while limiting the false discovery rate).</li>
</ul>

  <h3>Experimental designs for industrial experiments</h3>
  <p>Some further packages especially handle designs for industrial experiments
  that are often highly fractionated, intentionally confounded and have few extra degrees
  of freedom for error.</p> 
  
  <p>Fractional factorial 2-level designs are particularly important in industrial 
  experimentation. 
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>Package <pkg>FrF2</pkg> (Groemping 2014) is the most comprehensive R package for 
  their creation. It generates regular Fractional Factorial 
  designs for factors with 2 levels as well as Plackett-Burman type screening designs. 
  Regular fractional factorials default to maximum resolution minimum aberration designs 
  and can be customized in various ways, supported by an 
  incorporated catalogue of designs (including the designs catalogued by Chen, Sun and Wu 1993, 
  and further larger designs catalogued in Block and Mee 2005 and Xu 2009; 
  the additional package <pkg>FrF2.catlg128</pkg> provides a very large complete catalogue 
  for resolution IV 128 run designs with up to 23 factors for special purposes). 
  Analysis-wise, <pkg>FrF2</pkg> provides simple graphical analysis tools (normal and half-normal effects plots 
  (modified from <pkg>BsMD</pkg>, cf. below), main effects 
  plots and interaction plot matrices similar to those in Minitab software, and a cube 
  plot for the combinations of three factors). It can also show the alias structure 
  for regular fractional factorials of 2-level factors, regardless whether they have been 
  created with the package or not.<br/> 
  Fractional factorial 2-level plans can also be created by other R packages, 
  namely <pkg>BHH2</pkg> and <pkg>qualityTools</pkg> (but do not use function pbDesign from
  version 1.54 of that package!), or with a little bit more complication
	by packages <pkg>conf.design</pkg>, <pkg>planor</pkg> or <pkg>AlgDesign</pkg>.
  Package <pkg>oapackage</pkg> allows to generate (not necessarily orthogonal) 
  optimal fractional factorial 2-level designs with the possibility to prioritize 
  main effects higher than interactions. Package <pkg>ALTopt</pkg> provides optimal designs 
  for accelerated life testing.</li>
  
  <li>Package <pkg>BHH2</pkg> accompanies the 2nd edition of the book by Box, Hunter and Hunter 
  and provides various of its data sets. It can generate full and fractional factorial 
  two-level-designs from a number of factors and a list of defining relations 
  (function <code>ffDesMatrix()</code>, less comfortable than package FrF2). 
  It also provides several functions for analyzing data from 2-level factorial 
  experiments: The function anovaPlot assesses effect sizes relative to residuals, and
  the function <code>lambdaPlot()</code> assesses the effect of Box-Cox transformations on
  statistical significance of effects. </li>
  <li><pkg>BsMD</pkg> provides Bayesian charts as
  proposed by Box and Meyer (1986) as well as effects plots (normal, half-normal and
  Lenth) for assessing which effects are active in a fractional factorial experiment
  with 2-level factors; package <pkg>OBsMD</pkg> provides the functionality for follow-
  up experiments for resolving ambiguities after applying the Bayesian analysis of package 
  <pkg>BsMD</pkg>. </li>
  <li>Package <pkg>unrepx</pkg> provides a battery of methods for the assessment 
  of effect estimates from unreplicated factorial experiments, including many of 
  the effects plots also present in other packages, but also further possibilities.</li>
  <li>The small package <pkg>FMC</pkg> provides factorial designs with minimal 
  number of level changes; the package does not take any measures to account for the 
  statistical implications this may imply. Thus, using this package must be considered very risky for many 
  experimental situations, because in many experiments some variability is caused 
  by level changes. For such situations (and they are 
  the rule rather than the exception), minimizing the level changes without taking 
  precautions in the analysis will yield misleading results.</li>
  <li>Package <pkg>pid</pkg> accompanies an online book by Dunn (2010-2016) and also makes 
  heavy use of the Box, Hunter and Hunter book; it provides various data sets, which are 
  mostly from fractional factorial 2-level designs.</li>
  </ul>
   
  <p>
  Apart from tools for planning and analysing factorial designs, R also offers support for 
  response surface optimization for quantitative factors (cf. e.g. Myers and Montgomery 1995): 
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>Package <pkg>rsm</pkg> supports sequential 
  optimization with first order and second order response surface models (central composite 
  or Box-Behnken designs), offering 
  optimization approaches like steepest ascent and visualization of the response 
  function for linear model objects. Also, coding for response surface investigations is 
  facilitated. </li>
  <li>Package <pkg>DoE.wrapper</pkg> enhances design creation from package <pkg>rsm</pkg> 
  with the possibilities of automatically choosing the cube portion of central 
  composite designs and of augmenting 
  an existing (fractional) factorial 2-level design with a star portion.</li>
  <li>The small package <pkg>rsurface</pkg> provides rotatable central composite designs 
  for which the user specifies the minimum and maximum of the experimental variables instead 
  of the corner points of the cube.</li>
  <li>The small package <pkg>minimalRSD</pkg> provides central composite and Box-Behnken designs 
  with minimal number of level changes; the package does not take any measures to account for the 
  statistical implications this may imply. Thus, using this package must be considered very risky for many 
  experimental situations, because in many experiments some variability is caused 
  by level changes. For such situations (and they are 
  the rule rather than the exception), minimizing the level changes without taking 
  precautions in the analysis will yield misleading results.</li>
  <li>Package <pkg>OptimaRegion</pkg> provides functionality for inspecting the optimal 
  region of a response surface for quadratic polynomials and thin-plate spline models 
  and can compute a confidence interval for the distance between two optima.</li>
  <li>Package <pkg>Vdgraph</pkg> implements a variance dispersion graph (Vining 1993) for response 
  surface designs created by package <pkg>rsm</pkg>. Packages <pkg>VdgRsm</pkg> and <pkg>vdg</pkg>
  provide similar functionality with more variety.</li>
  <li>Package <pkg>qualityTools</pkg> can also create central composite designs 	 
	   and can visualize response surfaces.</li>
  <li>Package <pkg>EngrExpt</pkg> provides a collection of data sets from the book 
  <i>Introductory Statistics for Engineering Experimentation</i> by Nelson, Coffin and Copeland (2003).</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>In some industries, mixtures of ingredients are important; these require special designs, 
  because the quantitative factors have a fixed total. 
  Mixture designs are handled by packages <pkg>AlgDesign</pkg> (function <code>gen.mixture</code>, 
  lattice designs), <pkg>qualityTools</pkg> (function <code>mixDesign</code>,
  lattice designs and simplex centroid designs), and <pkg>mixexp</pkg> (several small functions for simplex centroid, 
  simplex lattice and extreme vertices designs as well as for plotting). </p>

  <p>Occasionally, supersaturated designs can be useful. 
  The two small packages <pkg>mkssd</pkg> and <pkg>mxkssd</pkg> provide fixed level and mixed level 
  k-circulant supersaturated designs. The aforementioned package <pkg>DoE.MIParray</pkg> can also 
  provide (small!) supersaturated arrays (by choosing resolution II), but requires the presence of at least one 
  of the commercial optimizers <a href="http://www.gurobi.com/products/modeling-languages/r">Gurobi</a> 
  or <a href="https://www.mosek.com/documentation/">Mosek</a>.</p>

  <h3>Experimental designs for computer experiments</h3>
  <p>Computer experiments with quantitative factors require special types of 
  experimental designs: it is often possible to include many different 
  levels of the factors, and replication will usually not be beneficial. Also, the 
  experimental region is often too large to assume that a linear or quadratic model adequately 
  represents the phenomenon under investigation. Consequently, it is desirable to fill 
  the experimental space with points as well as possible (space-filling designs) in such 
  a way that each run provides additional information even if some factors turn out to be 
  irrelevant.
  The <pkg>lhs</pkg> package provides latin hypercube designs for this purpose. 
  Furthermore, the package provides ways to analyse such computer experiments with
  emphasis on what follow-up experiments to conduct. Another package with similar orientation 
  is the <pkg>DiceDesign</pkg> package, which adds further ways to construct space-filling 
  designs and some measures to assess the quality of designs for computer experiments. The 
  package <pkg>DiceKriging</pkg> provides the kriging methodology which is often used for 
  creating meta models from computer experiments, the package <pkg>DiceEval</pkg> creates 
  and evaluates meta models (among others Kriging ones), and the package <pkg>DiceView</pkg> 
  provides facilities for viewing sections of multidimensional meta models.</p>
  
  <p>Package <pkg>MaxPro</pkg> provides maximum projection designs as introduced by 
  Joseph, Gul and Ba(2015). Package <pkg>SLHD</pkg> provides optimal sliced latin 
  hypercube designs according to Ba et al. (2015), package <pkg>sFFLHD</pkg> provides 
  sliced full factorial-based latin hypercube designs according to 
  Duan et al. (2017).
  Package <pkg>simrel</pkg> allows creation of designs for 
  computer experiments according to the Multi-level binary replacement (MBR) strategy 
  by Martens et al. (2010). Package <pkg>minimaxdesign</pkg> provides 
  minimax designs and minimax projection designs according to Mak and Joseph (2016).
  </p>
  
  <p>Package <pkg>tgp</pkg> is another package dedicated to planning and analysing 
  computer experiments. Here, emphasis is on Bayesian methods. 
  The package can for example be used with various kinds of (surrogate) models for 
  sequential optimization, e.g. with an expected improvement criterion for optimizing a noisy 
  blackbox target function. Packages <pkg>plgp</pkg> and <pkg>dynaTree</pkg> enhance the 
  functionality offered by <pkg>tgp</pkg> with particle learning facilities and learning for 
  dynamic regression trees.</p>
  
  <p>Package <pkg>BatchExperiments</pkg> is also designed for computer 
  experiments, in this case specifically for experiments with algorithms to be run 
  under different scenarios. The package is described in a technical report by 
  Bischl et al. (2012).</p>

  <h3>Experimental designs for clinical trials</h3>
  <p>This task view only covers specific design of experiments packages 
  (which will eventually also be removed here); there may be some 
  grey areas. Please, also consult the <a href="ClinicalTrials.html">ClinicalTrials</a> task view. 
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>Package <pkg>experiment</pkg> contains tools for clinical experiments,
  e.g., a randomization tool, and it provides a few special analysis options for clinical
  trials.</li> 
  <li>Package <pkg>ThreeArmedTrials</pkg> provides design and analysis tools for three-armed 
  superiority or non-inferiority trials. Beside the standard functionality, the package 
  includes the negative Binomial response situation discussed in Muetze et al. (2016).</li>  
  <li>Package <pkg>gsDesign</pkg> implements group sequential designs, package <pkg>GroupSeq</pkg> 
  gives a GUI for probability spending in such designs,

  Bayesian sample size calculations for these.</li>
  <li>Package <pkg>BOIN</pkg> provides Bayesian optimal interval designs, which are used in phase I clinical 
  trials for finding the maximum tolerated dose. </li>
  <li>The <pkg>DoseFinding</pkg> package provides functions for the design and analysis 
  of dose-finding experiments (for example pharmaceutical Phase II clinical trials); 
  it combines the facilities of the "MCPMod" package (maintenance discontinued; 
  described in Bornkamp, Pinheiro and Bretz 2009) with a special type of optimal designs for 
  dose finding situations (MED-optimal designs, or D-optimal designs, or a mixture of both; 
  cf., Dette et al. 2008).</li> 
  <li>Package <pkg>VNM</pkg> provides multi-objective optimal designs for simultaneously optimizing 
  inference about the shape of the dose-response curve, ED50 and minimum effective dose (MED) for certain classes of 
  logistic models. </li>
  <li>Package <pkg>TEQR</pkg> 
  provides toxicity equivalence range designs (Blanchard and Longmate 2010) for phase I clinical trials, 
  package <pkg>pipe.design</pkg> so-called <i>product of independent beta probabilities dose escalation</i> (PIPE) 
  designs for phase I. Package <pkg>dfpk</pkg> implements a Bayesian dose-finding design 
  using pharmacokinetics for phase I trials. Package <pkg>dfcrm</pkg> provides designs 
  for classical or TITE continual reassessment trials in phase I.</li>
  <li>Packages <pkg>dfcomb</pkg> and <pkg>dfmta</pkg> provide 
  phase I/II adaptive dose-finding designs for 
  combination studies or single-agent molecularly targeted agent, respectively.</li>
  <li>Packages <pkg>ph2bayes</pkg> and <pkg>ph2bye</pkg> are concerned with 
  Bayesian single arm phase II trials.</li>
  <li>Package <pkg>sp23design</pkg>	claims to offer seamless integration of phase II to III.</li>
    </ul>
  
  <h3>Experimental designs for special purposes</h3>
  <p>Various further packages handle special situations in experimental design:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Package <pkg>desirability</pkg> provides ways to combine several target criteria into a desirability function in order to simplify
  multi-criteria analysis; desirabilities are also offered as part of package <pkg>qualityTools</pkg>.</li> 
  <li><pkg>osDesign</pkg> designs studies nested in observational studies, <pkg>designmatch</pkg> can also be useful for this purpose.</li>
  <li><pkg>qtlDesign</pkg> is for quantitative trait locus designs,</li>
  <li><pkg>toxtestD</pkg> creates optimal designs for binary toxicity tests,</li>
  <li><pkg>hiPOD</pkg> provides optimal designs for pooled next generation sequencing experiments,</li>
  <li><pkg>designGG</pkg> creates optimal designs for genetical genomics experiments (see Li et al. 2009),</li>
  <li>packages <pkg>optbdmaeAT</pkg>, <pkg>optrcdmaeAT</pkg> and <pkg>soptdmaeA</pkg> provide optimal block designs, 
  optimal row-column designs, and sequential optimal or near-optimal block or row-column designs for 
  two-colour cDNA microarray experiments, with optimality according to an A-, MV-, D- or E-criterion.</li>
  <li>Package <pkg>docopulae</pkg> implements optimal designs for copula models according to 
  Perrone and Mueller (2016),</li> 
  <li><pkg>optDesignSlopeInt</pkg> provides an optimal design for the estimation of the ratio of slope to intercept, and</li>
  <li>Packages <pkg>edesign</pkg> and <pkg>MBHdesign</pkg> provide spatially balanced designs, 
  allowing the inclusion of prespecified (legacy) sites. The more elaborate package <pkg>geospt</pkg> 
  allows to optimize spatial networks of sampling points (see e.g. Santacruz, Rubiano and Melo 2014).</li>
  <li>Package <pkg>SensoMineR</pkg> contains special designs for
  sensometric studies, e.g., for the triangle test.</li>
  <li>Package <pkg>choiceDes</pkg> creates 
  choice designs with emphasis on discrete choice models and MaxDiff functionality; it is based on optimal designs.
  Package <pkg>idefix</pkg> provides D-efficient designs for discrete choice experiments based on the multinomial logit model, 
  and individually adapted designs for the mixed multinomial logit model (Crabbe et al. 2014).
  Package <pkg>support.CEs</pkg> provides tools for creating stated choice designs 
  for market research investigations, based on orthogonal arrays. </li>
